About Me 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in CSE department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung. Previously, I was an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science in Fudan University honored as Outstanding Undergraduate of Shanghai, supervised by Prof. Yanwei Fu. My research interests include Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, especially in representation learning, self-supervised learning and high-level vision perception.

Interest 
I love basketball and I'm also a big fan of Stepfen Curry, MVP point guard of Golden State Warriors, NBA. I'm a team member of my class's basketball team and often play Score / Power forward (SF/PF). In my spare time, I also play the role of a basketball game referee. Hope one day I can have a chance to see a home game of Warriors in Chase Center San Francisco!
